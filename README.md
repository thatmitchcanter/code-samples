# Code Samples for Mitch Canter

## Table of Contents

### StreamerSquare
This site is a SaaS custom-built LMS. The core of the site is built on WooCommerce and WooCommerce Memberships, as well as a subscription-based payment model. There are course filters set up on the /courses/ page, and the individual courses all have 'snippets' of content visible before the user is logged in. This is a complex site, and I'm happy to give you a tour as necessary, as we are still actively maintaining and adding features to the site weekly.
